We would like you to create a basic Laravel API called “Laravel Tech Task Demo API”. The purpose of the API is to display, add, edit and delete tasks.

Key criteria:
A task is formed of a name (min 3, max 100 characters) and a description (min 10, max 5000 characters).
Create an endpoint to view all tasks (no user restrictions).
A secured URL is required to edit or delete a task. Provide the appropriate endpoints to do this when a task is created.
No user accounts/ authentication is required.
Should be a RESTful API with a base of: /api/tasks.
Uses a NoSQL database (this is already setup).
Appropriate Unit Tests.
Uses Laravel Best Practices.
Bonus Criteria:
All requests should be logged in a log file via middleware.
Implement Soft Deleting.
